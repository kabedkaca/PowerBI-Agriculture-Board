# PowerBI-Agriculture-Board
A board that shows sale trend for agriculture products across USA

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kdstoys/agricultural-products-sales-data-2022-2023?resource=download

The board will show:
- total sales
- how many state the product are sold in
- How many Location products are sold
- How many supplier
- Avg price for each category
- Avg unit sold each day by category
- Total unit shipped, sold and on hand(unsold unit)

The trend:
- Sales based on product name
- Sales based on state
- Sales based on day
- Sales based on month

Maybe in future might add:
- sales based on supplier
- supplier and total unit sold
- supplier and state it covered
